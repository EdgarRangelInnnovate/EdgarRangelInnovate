**With optional features like emoji, scope, and issue reference:**

> :sparkles: feat(Component): Add a new feature. Closes: #123

## Commit Summary Suggestions

- Use `Added` for new features.
- Use `Changed` for changes in existing functionality.
- Use `Deprecated` for features that will be removed soon.
- Use `Removed` for features that have been removed.
- Use `Fixed` for any bug fixes.
- Use `Security` in case of vulnerabilities.

## Issue Referencing

You can close a related issue with the commit using the following keywords:

- close
- closes
- closed
- fix
- fixes
- fixed
- resolve
- resolves
- resolved

For example, you can use the phrase: Fixes: #1 or Fixes #1. Once the branch is merged into the main branch, the issue will be closed automatically.

## Jira Issue Referencing

When referencing a Jira issue, include the Jira ticket number in the commit message. This can be done similarly to issue tracking systems. Use a format like this:

`<emoji_type> <commit_type>(<scope>): <subject> (JIRA-123)`

**Example:**

:sparkles: feat(Component): Add a new feature (JIRA-123)

This helps in tracking development tasks in both Git and Jira simultaneously, providing clarity on what changes relate to which Jira tasks.
